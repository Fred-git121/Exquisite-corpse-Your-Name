# The New World
The new world started with a terminal command and a lot of coffee.  
Nobody knew what they were doing, but somehow it worked.  
Rumor has it, they still use:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
With every clone, a new door opened in the New World.
No stone or key was left unturned or unlocked, as the hours went by.
More coffee was made, and more memes were sent.
